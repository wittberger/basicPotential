# basicPotential

Visualization of the potential generated by a discrete charge distribution.


## Prerequisites
- Qt6
- <a href="https://arma.sourceforge.net/">Armadillo</a>

## Roadmap
- Graphical user interface to easily modify charge distribution. Calculate/visualize fields and potential live.
- Using CUDA-parallelization to speedup computation
